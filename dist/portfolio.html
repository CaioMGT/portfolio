            <h2 class="pl-2">Script Tabs is a plugin I wrote to satisfy my development needs in roblox. <br>
                I found that organizing my code, specially in big portions, was a humongous task, <br>
                due to the amount of scrolling (and looking around) that was necessary. <br>
                This plugin aims to solve this issue, by allowing user defined "tabs" that can be <br> 
                navigated to automatically at the press of a button<br> <br>
                I found it very useful in big scripts, that reached over 300 lines to portion<br> 
                my code down to bite size chunks, so I thought to release the plugin to whoever else needs it!<br>

            <h2 class="pl-2">This showcases a world generator, that is ran once the server starts. <br>
                To accomplish this, I used perlin noise to always generate a unique world, <br>
                similar to what games like Minecraft do. It uses Roblox's Terrain system <br>
                to always generate a smooth surface of grass, sand or rocks.<br>
                This ensures that the players can also swim in the water!

            <h2 class="pl-2">This was a commission I made for someone: <br>
                They requested me to create a Tower Defense AI that followed waypoints <br>
                until they reached the end, where they would deal damage to the end tower. <br>
                This showcases exactly that. The waypoints are visible only for testing purposes. <br>

                you will have to rejoin.)
