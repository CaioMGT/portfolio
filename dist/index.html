<!--I believe everyone should have the right to understand what they want, so I don't minify my files. I left some comments, if you want to take a look!
Although if you want to take a look at the css, I'd suggest going to the github instead. I preprocess my css files with TailwindCSS, so the processed
files are humongous, my code is actually way at the bottom. If you want a link, here you go: https://www.github.com/caiomgt/caiomgt.github.io/blob/main/main.css

      I'm a <span id="age">(Calculating Age)</span> year old Brazilian Full Stack developer and I like playing and making games. I have had an interest in gaming and development at a very young age. I started programming at the age of 10, using Codecademy, where I learnt my first language, <a class="text-neutral-400 dark:text-gray-400" href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp" target="_blank">C#</a>, following suit by <a class="text-neutral-400 dark:text-gray-400" href="https://www.javascript.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript </a> and <a class="text-neutral-400 dark:text-gray-400" href="https://www.lua.org/" target="_blank">Lua</a>.<br>
      I learnt them and I enjoyed using them, whether for my small shenanigans or for some low budget games, so I pursued further... <br>
      With a lot of free time, my skillset increased and, because of programming, I met a lot of great friends and made many connections, I joined communities that shared the same passion I had, while also being able to share my projects to get another point of view! <br>
      This really motivated me to keep going to where I am today! I consider myself a capable Programmer and I want to pursue this as my full-time career in the future <br>
      I have worked with various Programming Languages and technologies before, here are some: <br>
      <ul class="text-gray-500 text-base grid grid-cols-2">
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>MongoDB</li>
        <li>TypeScript</li>
        <li>OpenGL</li>
        <li>C#</li>
        <li>Tailwind CSS</li>
        <li>C</li>
        <li>Windows Forms</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>PyGame</li>
        <li>Kotlin</li>
        <li>Love2D</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Unity</li>
        <li>Lua</li>
        <li>Kord (and extensions)</li>
        <li>Arduino</li>
        <li>discord.py</li>
      </ul>
      Outside of Programming, I've dabbled in art and animation before, making some simple animations using Adobe Flash. <br>
      I play Keyboard (The instrument) and have used FL Studio to compose songs as a hobby, although I don't intend on releasing them to the public.<br>
      My favorite games are Minecraft and Payday 2, if you play any of those, hit me up on discord ;) <br>
